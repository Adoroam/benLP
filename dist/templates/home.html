					<!--Intro Paragraph-->
				<p>
					<p><em> Hello and Welcome </em></p>
					My name is Charles Benjamin Eaton, and you've reached my Learning Portfolio.
					This website is dedicated to my CIS 3347 class at the <a href="httpd://uh.edu/">University of Houston</a>.
					It is the culmination of the last 15 weeks of the Spring Semester of 2016, a final product that represents the end and the beginning.
					The end signifying this semester and the beginning marking the greater knowledge of Information Systems Infrastructure and Networks.
					This class truly increased my understanding of enterprise level networking infrastructure. I find myself wandering the campus
					thinking of all the possible ways that these buildings are connected onto one Campus Area Network.
				</p>

					<!--Body Paragraph-->
				<p>
					I invite you to the <strong>modules</strong> page of my Learning Portfolio where I showcase my best works and how I best learned from them.
					Attached to each module you find an assignment that includes definitions, questions and answers, and often
					you will find the notes that I took for that specific reading/video assignment. Feel free to use any of the content,
					I hope that it may benefit you (the reader) in some way or another. Cheers!
				</p>
