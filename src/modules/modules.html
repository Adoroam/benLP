				Each individual week of this semester was coupled into <em>one</em> of the <strong>four</strong> total modules
				that this class followed as directives for success.
				At the end every module there was a comprehensive exam over that module which included a range of assignments and book readings.
				You may consider the following as "homeworks," but I believe they served greater purpose than just an assignment. Between the 
				readings from the text, and the online videos from <a href="http://www.professormesser.com/" target="_blank">Professor Messer</a> and 
				<a href="http://www.elithecomputerguy.com/" target="_blank">Eli the Computer Guy</a>, these modules served as week long 
				study guides, in which concepts provided by the text was made clearer by the videos that were assigned to watch.

				Module one served as a foundation that really set the tone for what to expect in this class, 
				specifically the ISO/OSI model, and the physical media that interacts with a network infrastructure.
				I placed a lot of focus on the protocols that are handled within the OSI Modela and the type of media
				that it used to interact from layer to layer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bellow you will find two assignments that I enjoyed completing. I have found that taking notes whilst reading
				or watching videos helps me understand the information and the concepts. Many times I'd answer the questions
				without having to consult my notes or any other resource. <strong>Enjoy!</strong>

				Module two we start breaking down the OSI model into pieces, focusing more on individual 
				layers, and the types of protocols concerning those layers. For this module we focused on the Data Link Layer,
				the Network Layer, and the Transport Layer. I placed a lot of focus on this assignment because I felt
				it was one of the more important subject of the module. I recall getting this test being my highest grade.

				Module three focused on how data communication moved from one network/subnet/physical 
				structure to another with the use of backbones, different broadband connection types, DNS, and a 
				framework for network security. I enjoyed the WAN Technologies assignment most of all, despite being
				rather short, I did get a lot of great notes from Professor Messer's video that I think benefited me
				for the test and a better understanding of the material.

				Module four was my favorite module because it shed light on how wireless networking is made possible. At a fundamental level,
				I knew that some sort of wave was sent from antenna to antenna. However, I learned that it goes deeper, that it starts at an alternating current
				that moves 1's and 0's to an antenna that produces radio frequencies that move within the electromagnetic spectrum. Simple, right? 
				It discusses the different agencies and their branches that govern the space and time which radio frequencies can travel.
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore, it introduces a focus on Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things. This seems appropriate because it demonstrates 
				how everything we've learned up to this point in class is all tying to a new level of infrastructure that is being adopted as a standard.
			</p>
			<p>
				For this module I read every chapter assigned and took notes on what I found to be the most important information.
				The deliverables were to write a brief synopsis over what I learned and why it is significant to me.
				In chapter two of CWNA, Radio Frequency Fundamentals, was the most eye opening for me, so I chose to write my synopsis on it.
				In chapter 13 of Foundation of Modern Networking, Cloud Computing, the different types of cloud deployments 'twas the most interesting, and thus I wrote a synopsis on such.
				
				
				Bellow you will find a links to the synopsis and the notes I took for each chapter.
