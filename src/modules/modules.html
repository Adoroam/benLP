				Each individual week of this semester was coupled into <em>one</em> of the <strong>four</strong> total modules
				that this class followed as directives for success.
				At the end every module there was a comprehensive exam over that module which included a range of assignments and book readings.
				You may consider the following as "homeworks," but I believe they served greater purpose than just an assignemnt. Between the 
				readings from the text, and the online videos from <a href="http://www.professormesser.com/">Professor Messer</a> and 
				<a href="http://www.elithecomputerguy.com/">Eli the Computer Guy</a>, this modules served as week long 
				study guides which concepts provided by the text was made clearer by the videos that were assigned to watch.

				Module one served as a foundation that really set the tone for what to expect in this class, 
				specifically the ISO/OSI model, and the physical media that interacts with a network infrastructure.

				Module two we start breaking down the OSI model into pieces, focusing more on individual 
				layers, and the types of protocols concerning those layers.

				Module three focused on how data communication moved from one network/subnet/physical 
				structure to another with the use of backbones, different broadband connection types, DNS, and a 
				framework for network security.

				Module four was my favorite module because it shed light on how wireless networking is made possible. At a fundamental level,
				I knew that some sort of wave was sent from antenna to antenna. However, I learned that it goes deeper, that it starts at an alternating current
				that moves 1's and 0's to an antenna that produces radio frequencies that move within the electromagnetic spectrum. Simple, right? 
				It discusses the different agencies and their branches that govern the space and time which radio frequencies can travel.
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore, it introduces a focus on Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things. This seems appropriate because it demonstrates 
				how everything we've learned up to this point in class is all tying to a new level of infrastructure that is being adopted as a standard.
			</p>
			<p>
				For this module I read every chapter assigned and took notes on what I found to be the most important information.
				The deliverables were to write a brief synopsis over what I learned and why it is significant to me.
				In Chapter two, Radio Frequency Fundamentals, was the most eye opening for me, so I chose to write my synopsis on it.
				
				Bellow you will find a link to the synopsis and the notes I took for that chapter.
