						There are only so many words in the English language that I can use to describe how noticeably <strong>harder</strong> this semester was
						in comparison to previous ones. And given that the last two semesters I achieved over 3.5 GPA both times (<b>3.9 GPA last semester</b>),
						I have to wonder what changed so <em>drastically</em> this Spring 2016. Rather than trying to explain it, here's a visual representation of how I 
						saw my work ethic for the last 5 months:

						At first glance, you may have thought the same thing I did, "<strong>this guy is amazing!</strong>" Only to be sadly disappointed, yet very much amused.
						It was very hectic and I was always rushed to finish something last minute. All of which can be attributed to my procrastination.
						It was unfortunate because I feel that it was a detriment to the amount of knowledge I could have walked away with from this class. 
						<b>However</b>, I can say that my understanding and respect for the ISO/OSI model has grown tenfold. Before it always seemed like, 
						"oh, it's that list of... things I keep forgetting about regarding networking." I always dismissed the networking side of IT as something 
						I didn't really want to be involved in, but now I know that there is truly no avoiding it. Every facet of IT and every IT professional (current and future)
						should at least know the fundamentals of the OSI Model and how packets are rounters from one network (physical or virtual) to another. 
					</p></h4>

						Even with the small amount of data that I feel I am walking away with, I now have greater confidence in myself to be able to troubleshoot
						network related issues and determine how to resolve them. As I wish to go into a Linux Sys Admin position, monitoring server health,
						fluctuations, and input/output to any one server, having completed this class should prove very beneficial. The book for this class, 
						'Business Data Communications & Networking', is likely one of the only books that I have had to purchase for a class that I geniunly
						enjoyed. The content was straight to the point, easy to read, and important data stood out without having to flip back and forth. As stated
						in my modules, the combination of reading over the chapters, watching the videos and taking notes for both resources really helped me
						conceptualize all of the information being absorbed.

						Mr. Crowley is without a doubt an excellent professor, smart, all around righteous dude. He's old school, very understanding, it is
						admirable to hear of his previous work in the networking field and seeing the extent of his knowledge. Here's a personal thank you, sir!
						If more time was available, it would have been pretty sweet to set up a private network within the classroom with some enterprise hardware.
						Maybe have a LAN? We could play Quake3. :]
